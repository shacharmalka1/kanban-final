3. you can move tasks from one list to another by clicking the wanted task and then pressing "alt+ number"
   the number should be 1,2 or 3 depending on the list you want to be the destination.

4. a global search bar that shows you only the tasks that includes the characters written inside the input.

5. a current clean looking design that makes the site readable for long term usage. using cool tones to give a feeling of relief. in addition, while hovering over the lists you get a shadow affect.
